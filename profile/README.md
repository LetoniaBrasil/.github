_Letonia Brasil_ is the front of the Associação Brasileira de Cultura Leta (Brazilian Association of Latvian Culture) and its associate organizations and projects in social media. 

Our objective is to preserve and divulge Latvian culture in Brazil. We often work closely with [Pasaules Brīvo Latviešu Apvienība](https://www.pbla.lv/) and the [Latvian Ministry of Culture](https://www.km.gov.lv/). Our associate organizations include, among others, the Latvian Brazilian Choir, the Ijui Latvian Center, the Latvian Group of Curitiba, the Latvian Honorary Consulate of Brazil and the "Letos do Asfalto" Motorclub. More information on each one can be found on [our website](https://letoniabrasil.org/).

## Additional Points: 
Some minor points that need to be cleared: 
- The working languages are Portuguese and Latvian, but English is also commonly used in documents intended for international circulation (such was the case of the Demographic Census in 2018). The documentation on github and any code will also be in English for use for other communities. 
- We do not represent our associate organizations, such as the Choir. We work in tandem in projects but each organization has its own governance.
